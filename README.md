## Downloads
In the github downloads section ...eventually

## Setup
May not work like this on windows, but you'll figure it out
```bash
./gradlew sDecW idea
```
Then install the scala plugin for IntelliJ and open the project.

## Contributing
When merging a pull request we **require** you to sign the last (or ideally all) commit done on a branch before opening the pull request.
If not all commits are signed you take full responsibility for all unsigned commits, even if someone else did them.
